We are involved in keeping order to the site, keeping the rules intact and making sure no one breaks them as well as coming up with ideas for new rules when available. We help keep the site family friendly and safe for everyone to talk in and keep up a friendly, happy community for other users. When we handle the rules we make sure to keep up a positive tone so not to be rude and we maintain ourselves so we can be role models on the site and help others to the best of our abilites. I&#39;m very happy to have you on board the team seeing as you&#39;ve gotten accepted and I hope you make me and the site proud and have fun serving as a Captain for the site.&nbsp;</i></div>

<div style="background:white;width:70%;height:50%"><em>I have covered a few basic descriptions of our job above as you read coming into the club, but here I shall go into a bit of further detail about what we do down to the core. As the Captains, we do many things, one of them is we watch over chat to make sure everything is friendly and rule abiding in there. Secondly, we watch the topics and make sure all rules are abided in there as well, you have the power to lock topics or delete them according to how you see fit as long as it&#39;s an appropriate reason as to why the topic should be removed/locked. You must also live up to the role model status and very much abide by the rules yourself.&nbsp;</em></div>

One of the topics is an Absence Page,&nbsp;if you know you are going to be missing from your job for a certaint amount of time, I would like you to post in that topic, further instructions are given once you click on the topic. Secondly is a weekly report forum, where you&#39;ll update on the topics you&#39;ve checked and chat warnings just so we can have records and maintain eyes on any rule breakers around the site to see if further assertiveness is required.
